Hey, I'm hungry
-------------------------

- A platform to eliminate food waste by connecting people in need of food to those with leftover/excess food

People in need of food:
- Those who frequent homeless shelters and soup kitchens
- Makes it easier to find higher quality food

People with leftover/excess food:
- Restaurants with leftover meals from cancelled/mistaken orders
- People with leftover food from personal/family meals
- Penn State: dining commons throw away a lot of food, this makes it available to those who need it

Ideas:
- Location where food can be deposited and retrieved is called the "Drop Zone"
- Public places can set up Drop Zones
	- Restaurants/fast food
	- Supermarkets
	- Public libraries
- You can also set up a home drop zone
- Point system to encourage people to use it
- This is a way for soup kitchens to be available 24/7

Flow:
- Someone with food goes on the website/app and signs up for an account
- They take a photo of the food that they have and it is listed with their location (although this is not public)
- People who want food go on the app and see a list of foods organized by distance from them
- They go to a drop zone and open the box with the kiosk or their phone
- Take the food, the drop zone is deactivated until the next time someone puts food in it
